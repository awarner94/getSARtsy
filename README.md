# Motivation

Santa Catalina Island is a small island located about 25 miles off the coast from mainland Southern California. It is home to about 4,000 across it's two towns, Avalon and Two Harbors (data from 2010 census), although easily 10 times that amount visit the quaint towns yearly via cruise ships or weekend get aways. The majority of the land on Catalina Island is protected by the Catalina Island Conservancy, uniquely locking the towns' borders to a fixed size. Isolated, the island has to ship in all of it's resources from the mainland. Becuase of it's unique geographical and geopolitical situation, the island's fresh water only has one source: rain.

The historic droughts of Southern California wrecked havoc on the islanders (my then 90-year-old grandmother was taking sponge baths in the kitchen sink). Residents got strict monthly allowances of daily water usage, likely to offset the lack of conservation offeorts of ever rising tourism. As climate change worsens weather patterns, the residents of Catalina Island live in the constant fear of an imminent water shortage, and with the geographic isoloation, this will have dire consequences on not only the residents and their livelyhood but also on conservatino efforts of the island's delicate (and untraditional) ecosystem.

# Goal/Future Goal

For this contribution to NASA's Space Apps Challenge 2023, the goal was to use SAR data to explore vegetation change on the island from 2009 vs 2022. Future goals include plotting the amount of rainfall over a large sum of months/years and project future rainfall trends.

The following are the sources for the data used/planned to be used:

SAR Data: 
1. JPL UAVSAR (https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/product.pl?jobName=ChanIs_30102_09071_001_090916_L090_CX_01#data, https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/product.pl?jobName=ChanIs_30104_22054_013_221130_L090_CX_01#data)
Downloaded both geoTIF files and used those in QGIS.
