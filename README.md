Santa Catalina Island is a small island located about 25 miles off the coast from mainland Southern California and is home to about 4,000 across it's two towns, Avalon and Two Harbors (data from 2010 census), although easily 10 times that amount visit the quaint towns yearly via cruise ships or weekend get aways. The majority of the land on Catalina Island is protected by the Catalina Island Conservancy, uniquely locking the towns' borders to a fixed size. Isolated from common resources, the island has to ship in all of it's resources from the mainland. Becuase of it's unique geographical and geopolitical situation, the island's fresh water only has one source: rain.

The historic droughts of Southern California wrecked havoc on the islanders (my then 90-year-old grandmother was taking sponge baths in the kitchen sink). Residents got strict monthly allowances of daily water usage, likely to offset the lack of conservation offeorts of ever rising tourism. As climate change worsens weather patterns, the residents of Catalina Island live in the constant fear of an imminent water shortage, and with the geographic isoloation, this will have dire consequences.

For this contribution to NASA's Space Apps Challenge 2023, the goal was to explore the water and temperature data of Catalina Island over the course of the past few decades, or really whatever data was readily available.

The following are the sources for the data used/planned to be used:

Temp and Weather Data: Socioeconomic Data and Applicartions Center - SEDAC (https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/sdei-high-res-daily-uhe-1983-2016/data-download, https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/sdei-high-res-daily-uhe-1983-2016)

SAR Data: JPL UAVSAR (https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/product.pl?jobName=ChanIs_30102_09071_001_090916_L090_CX_01#data)
